            <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
             <p>I've lived in Georgia for 10 total years and spent my childhood in a small town in Florida. My husband and I now live in Cumming, Georgia.
            We would be interested in moving to Atlanta once I land a job as a jr developer. My brother,
             his wife, son and soon to be daughter live there and family is too important to not be close and see often. </p>
